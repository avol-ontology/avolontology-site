Definition 
A Declared Evaluation Context is an explicit, rule-bound specification that defines which 
externally governed parameters are in force when AVOL instantiates a value representation.  A 
Declared Evaluation Context: 
• is supplied explicitly at evaluation time 
• is never inferred, derived, or assumed by the system under any condition 
• is deterministic, inspectable, and finite 
• references externally defined rules or entitlements, not user preferences or intent 
 
A Declared Evaluation Context does not alter AVOL’s ontology, conversion logic, or aggregation 
rules.  It constrains which rule-bound facts are considered operative for a given evaluation. 
 
What a Declared Evaluation Context Is Not 
When multiple Declared Evaluation Contexts are valid, selection among them is external to 
AVOL. AVOL SHALL NOT infer, prioritize, reconcile, or select among contexts, nor combine or 
adjudicate outputs across contexts.  A Declared Evaluation Context is not: 
• Personalization 
• Preference expression 
• Intent signaling 
• Outcome optimization 
• Ranking logic 
• Recommendation logic 
• Adaptive weighting 
• Probabilistic or predictive modeling within the canonical (AVOL-Base) value 
representation 
 
Context declaration does not express normative importance or evaluative judgment.  It declares 
only which externally governed conditions apply. 
 
Purpose and Rationale 
Declared Evaluation Context exists to allow AVOL to represent value as it exists under explicitly 
specified conditions, without inference or steering by the system. 
 
Many transactional value components are contingent on rule-governed states (e.g., 
loyalty tier rules, payment instrument terms, contractual entitlements). If those states are not 
explicitly declared, a system would be required to assume, guess, or infer which rules apply. 
AVOL does not perform such inference. 
 
Declared Evaluation Context eliminates that ambiguity by requiring all contingent conditions to be 
explicitly supplied, allowing AVOL to apply externally defined rules deterministically, without 
interpreting user intent, likelihood of benefit realization, or preference. 
 
Absence of a Declared Evaluation Context is not an error condition. In such cases, AVOL 
evaluates the option under AVOL-Base, the context-free canonical instantiation. 
 
Declared Evaluation Context provides a formal mechanism to: 
• Resolve rule-dependent value components 
• Preserve determinism and inspectability 
• Avoid implicit personalization or intent inference 
• Maintain AVOL’s neutrality boundary

Canonicality Within Context 
AVOL guarantees canonical outputs within a Declared Evaluation Context. 
 
Canonicality Rule: 
Identical inputs + identical declared evaluation context → identical outputs 
 
Canonicality is preserved per context, not across contexts. 
 
Different declared contexts may yield different outputs without violating canonicality, provided 
that: 
• Each context is explicitly declared 
• Each context is rule-bound and deterministic 
• No context mutates AVOL’s ontology or computation rules 
 
There is no implicit or default context beyond AVOL-Base. 
 
Structure and Constraints of a Declared Evaluation Context 
A valid Declared Evaluation Context must satisfy all of the following: 
 
1. Explicitness 
1.1. All contextual parameters are declared prior to evaluation 
1.2. No parameter may be optional, inferred, or implied 
 
2. Rule-Boundedness 
2.1. Each parameter references externally defined, inspectable rules 
2.2. Rules originate outside AVOL (e.g., issuer terms, program definitions, etc.) 
 
3. Determinism 
3.1. Given the same declared context, results are invariant 
3.2. No stochastic or adaptive behavior is permitted 
 
4. Immutability During Evaluation 
4.1. The declared context is fixed for the duration of an evaluation 
4.2. Context cannot be modified mid-computation 
 
Allowed Contextual Parameters 
Declared Evaluation Context may include parameters that reference externally governed 
entitlements or conditions, such as: 
• Loyalty program tier 
• Payment instrument type 
• Contractual eligibility flags 
• Jurisdictional rule applicability 
• Program enrollment status 
• Any other externally defined, rule-governed entitlement or condition whose applicability is 
explicitly declared and independently inspectable 
 
These parameters: 
• Reference what rules apply, not what the user prefers 
• Do not encode subjective value or intent 
• Do not alter AVOL’s conversion logic 
 
Contextual parameters that do not meet these criteria are non-permissible within AVOL. Externally governed parameters are defined and maintained outside AVOL and are not authored, selected, curated, or modified by AVOL for evaluative purposes. 
AVOL does not evaluate likelihood, utility, or desirability of these parameters. It only applies their externally defined rules if declared.

Prohibited Behaviors Within Context 
Within a Declared Evaluation Context, AVOL must not: 
• Infer user intent or preference 
• Learn or adapt weights over time 
• Rank or order options 
• Recommend or label outcomes as “best” 
• Optimize toward any outcome 
• Incorporate likelihood, probability, forecasting, or expected-value assumptions into the 
canonical (AVOL-Base) value representation 
• Resolve ambiguity through heuristics 
 
Any such behavior constitutes decisioning and is explicitly outside AVOL’s scope. 
 
Non-canonical analyses, projections, simulations, or decision systems may operate on AVOL 
outputs, provided that the canonical value representation remains intact and distinguishable. 
 
Separation From Decisioning 
Declared Evaluation Context does not perform decisioning. It does not: 
• Compare options 
• Determine superiority or preference 
• Influence ordering or visibility 
• Produce choice guidance 
 
Any interpretation, comparison, ranking, or recommendation occurs strictly downstream of 
AVOL. 
 
Relationship to AVOL-Base 
AVOL-Base is the context-free instantiation of AVOL. 
• AVOL-Base applies when no Declared Evaluation Context is supplied 
• It represents value under baseline, non-contingent rules 
• It is canonical, deterministic, and inspectable 
 
Declared Evaluation Contexts are additive instantiations, not mutations: 
• They do not override AVOL-Base 
• They do not rewrite AVOL’s ontology 
• They do not alter conversion or aggregation rules 
Multiple contexts may coexist, each producing its own canonical output. 
 
It produces context-instantiated value representations only.

Coexistence of Multiple Contexts 
Multiple Declared Evaluation Contexts may be applied to the same option without contaminating 
neutrality, provided that: 
• Each context is independently declared 
• Each context is evaluated separately 
• Outputs are not combined, weighted, or collapsed within AVOL 
 
AVOL does not reconcile or adjudicate between contexts.  It represents value as instantiated 
under each declared context, nothing more. 
 
Governance and Enforcement 
Declared Evaluation Context is a first-class, governed construct within AVOL.  Compliance is 
enforced through versioned specifications and formal review of any changes affecting context 
structure or admissibility.  Any context that: 
• Is inferred rather than declared 
• Introduces adaptive or heuristic behavior 
• Encodes preference, intent, or optimization 
• Mutates AVOL’s ontology or computation rules 
is non-compliant with AVOL’s canonical posture.

Boundary Statement 
Declared Evaluation Context allows AVOL to support contextualized value evaluation without 
becoming a personalization, ranking, or decision system. 
AVOL’s responsibility ends at representation. 
 
Context does not extend that responsibility.
